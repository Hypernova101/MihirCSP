    "## ✍️ **AP CSP Blog: What I Learned From Peer-Created Lessons**\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few weeks, as a class, we've explored several student-led AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) modules. These lessons offered gave me many new learnings about the key topics of the MCQ's, which I will use to prepare for the AP test. Below is a summary of all the topics that we have talked about in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before I get started, I want to highlight the fact that I did all the college board practice MCQ's **before time**, and always submitted my lessons homework on time with my best effort. I believe that this is the only way to reinforce learning, and is something I have practiced throughout this short \"unit\" of this class.\n",

    "# Big Idea 5 Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 1. [Beneficial & Harmful Effects of Computing](https://sanpranav.github.io/QcommVNE_Frontend/Benefical)\n",
    "This lesson examined the **double-edged sword** of technological advancement. I saw how innovations like telemedicine, smart assistants, and automation have led to life-changing benefits — especially in accessibility, health, and productivity. But I also learned how those same innovations can displace jobs, compromise privacy, and increase screen addiction. A strong point in the module was the case study on **self-driving cars**, where convenience collides with safety, unemployment, and accountability concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌐 2. [Digital Divide](https://sanpranav.github.io/QcommVNE_Frontend/DigitalD)\n",
    "The **digital divide** refers to unequal access to computing and the internet, especially across income, geography, and age groups. I explored how communities without internet access face disadvantages in education, healthcare, and job opportunities. The lesson also included powerful visuals — like global internet penetration maps — that highlighted systemic inequities. I now better understand how important policy, infrastructure, and education initiatives are in closing this gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚖️ 3. [Computing Bias](https://shawnray09.github.io/computerbias/2025/03/18/computing-bias.html)\n",
    "One of the most eye-opening lessons. I learned how **bias in data** or algorithms can lead to unfair or even harmful outcomes. Examples included facial recognition systems with high error rates for people of color and AI hiring tools unintentionally discriminating against women. The lesson explained how bias can creep in through historical data, unrepresentative training sets, or lack of diversity in development teams. It encouraged critical thinking about *who* designs algorithms and *how* fairness can be prioritized.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤝 4. [Crowdsourcing](https://vibha1019.github.io/team_teach_tri3/crowdsourcing-lesson)\n",
    "This lesson was all about the **power of the crowd** in modern computing. From Wikipedia to Waze, I learned how crowdsourcing uses the collective input of users to generate or improve content. The lesson highlighted strengths like speed, cost-effectiveness, and scalability — as well as drawbacks such as misinformation and volunteer fatigue. It also dove into ethical concerns: Should people contributing data or labor get compensated? Can we trust anonymous input?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📜 5. [Legal & Ethical Computing](https://thepencilsharpener.github.io/Biotech-SKANZ-Frontend/legalandethical/)\n",
    "This module walked through real-world tech laws like **DMCA**, **COPPA**, and **GDPR**, breaking down legal responsibilities in coding and data handling. I especially liked the ethical dilemmas it presented — like using someone’s code snippet without credit or collecting user data without clear consent. The lesson emphasized that being a programmer doesn’t just mean writing efficient code; it also means acting responsibly and considering the **social impact** of your solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔐 6. [Safe Computing](https://thepencilsharpener.github.io/Biotech-SKANZ-Frontend/safecomputing/)\n",
    "An essential lesson on **cyber hygiene** — from protecting passwords to recognizing phishing scams. It included real-world cases of cyberattacks and gave clear strategies like two-factor authentication, secure browsing, and antivirus usage. One key takeaway was the importance of **behavioral awareness**: knowing how to spot social engineering tactics or suspicious links is just as important as having good software protections.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 7. [Binary Search](https://hypernova101.github.io/MihirCSP/2025/03/19/binarysearch.html)\n",
    "I taught this lesson! By teaching this lesson, I learned much more about how binary search works, how the logic and implementation of this algorithm repeatedly divides a list in half to quickly find a target rather than manually iterating through every item. This has a better time complexity as well. (time complexity is something discussed later!). I liked making the pseudocodes and the walkthroughs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 8. [Lists and Filtering](https://sanpranav.github.io/QcommVNE_Frontend/ListsFilter)\n",
    "This topic helped me better understand how programs manage and manipulate collections of data. I studied how to filter lists based on conditions using loops or list comprehensions. This is a critical skill for apps that sort user inputs, analyze survey data, or run simulations. The lesson gave real examples like filtering user ages from a dataset or isolating tweets with certain keywords — practical use cases that tied into projects I’ve done.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎲 9. [Simulation & Random Algorithms](https://vibha1019.github.io/team_teach_tri3/simulationteamteach)\n",
    "Simulations are **models that imitate real-world systems**. This lesson showed how randomness can help predict unpredictable outcomes — like traffic flow, disease spread, or weather patterns. I also learned how randomness plays a role in gaming and cryptography. One cool example was modeling how a virus might spread through a population with different rates of exposure and recovery — and how tweaking one variable impacts the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⏱️ 10. [Big O and Algorithm Efficiency](https://sanpranav.github.io/QcommVNE_Frontend/BigO)\n",
    "This lesson focused on analyzing how code behaves as the input size grows. I learned to categorize performance using **Big O notation**:  \n",
    "- O(1) for constant time  \n",
    "- O(n) for linear loops  \n",
    "- O(n²) for nested loops  \n",
    "- O(log n) for efficient searches  \n",
    "- O(2ⁿ) for exponential problems  \n",
    "This helped me identify bottlenecks in programs and choose the right algorithm depending on scale. The lesson included great visualizations and comparisons between different time complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 **Big Idea 3 Learnings and Summary**\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **3.5: Iteration**\n",
    "- **Main Ideas**:\n",
    "  - Loops repeat actions until a condition is false.\n",

    "- ✅ **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  for i in range(5):\n",
    "      print(\"Iteration:\", i)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **3.6: Boolean Expressions and Logic**\n",
    "- **Main Ideas**:\n",
    "  - Boolean expressions evaluate to `True` or `False`.\n",
    "  - Use `and`, `or`, `not` to combine conditions.\n",
    "- ✅ **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  is_raining = True\n",
    "  has_umbrella = False\n",
    "\n",
    "  if is_raining and not has_umbrella:\n",
    "      print(\"Stay inside!\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **3.7: Conditional Statements**\n",
    "- **Main Ideas**:\n",
    "  - Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to execute different code based on conditions.\n",

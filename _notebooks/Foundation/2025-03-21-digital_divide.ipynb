    "Urban residents will have greater internet infrastructure, but digital divide problems are more about affordability and digital proficiency. For example, low-income city residents may have access to broadband but cannot pay monthly subscription fees. Rural areas face more infrastructure-related problems, such as thin broadband penetration because of thin population. Urban societies may have alternatives like low-income household subsidy programs, while rural societies may have wireless broadband deployment, satellite internet, or local networks."

    "The COVID-19 pandemic brought to the forefront the digital divide as students with no dependable internet or devices fell behind in online learning, resulting in substantial educational loss. In medicine, telemedicine visits became an essential service, but numerous low-income or rural patients didn't have the internet capabilities necessary for virtual visits. Many occupations also shifted to working remotely, leaving behind those who do not have computers or reliable broadband, further expanding economic divides. These examples show how the pandemic made online connectivity more important than ever and exposed structural inequities in connectivity."

<p style="color:white; align=center">Hello! My name is Mihir Bapat. I am a Freshman at Del Norte High School with heritage from India. The above picture is my Freeform picture. It covers the very things I find to be a part of myself. To start off, I am a massive sports fan. I like to watch and play Soccer and Cricket. I support Liverpool FC in Soccer, and the Mumbai Indians and team India in cricket. Finally, in my free time, I like to code, play the piano, and play Fortnite while listening to Spotify. </p>
